- The SHA-512 hashing algorithm is currently one of the best and most secure hashing algorithms after hashes like MD5 and SHA-1 have been broken down. Due to their complicated nature, it is not well accepted and SHA-256 is a general standard, but the industry is slowly moving towards this hashing algorithm.
